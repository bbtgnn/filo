# Prove

## src-1

A text block test

- highlight the text and then use the "split" buttons to split the block
- ID creation logic is interesting

## src-2

Joined some examples from `svelte-dnd-action` to familiarize with the library

## src-3

Implemented a `block` class
(instead of a generic object used in the exercises)

## src-4

Trying to place cursor in text and use it to split the block
